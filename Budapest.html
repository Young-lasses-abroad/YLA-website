            <h3>The Budapest Lady</h3>
            <p>The lady of Budapest signifies freedom, and looks over both Buda and Pest. I warn
            <br>you know- it is a climb! I am particularly unfit, forgot a bottle of water and regretted
            <br>it big time. There is a bus you can get to the top (we didn‚Äôt realise until at the top!) 
            <br>But I would say I‚Äôd you can the walk is more than worth it. You get some of the best views 
            <br>of the city. Treat yo self to a chimney cake on the way back down- you‚Äôve earned it. </p>

            <h3>Great Market Hall</h3>
            <p>This is a Market that has to be seen, smelled & food tasted while your in Budapest. 
              <br>It has an array of raw produce on the ground floor. Each of which are strangely larger than
              <br>ours- think tomatoes the side of a tennis ball! Upstairs you will find hot food- be careful 
              <br>not to go to the tourist traps, not the best food quality or taste. My favourite part was 
              <br>the lower ground floor, they had a whole floor just for different types of pickles! Ignore
              <br>the people outside selling fake Gucci scarves, and be wary of pick pocketers. </p>

            <h3>The Sz√©chenyi Medicinal Bath</h3>
            <p>Budapest has a ton of medicinal baths that are still used by locals. And Sz√©chenyi Medicinal 
              <br>Bath is by far the biggest. It feels like it goes on forever indoors- pools of all different
              <br>temperatures, steam rooms, and plunge pools are what you can expect as your moving through. 
              <br>My favourite part was the outdoor pool, it was large with 2 different sides. We went on a Friday
              <br>& a Saturday. You get a very different vibe here depending on what day/time you go. If your after
              <br>a more local vibe that is relaxing go early in the morning, on a weekday. If you want a touristy,
              <br>but fun atmosphere go in the evening on a weekend or a Friday.

  <h3>üöãSecondly, how do you get around to do all these amazing things!?</h3>
  <p> We know keeping yourself safe is a top priority when galavanting abroad 
      but have no fear gals, there are plenty of options.
      details about particular city and what  they have to offer
  </p>
  
  <h4> Heres our top 3 recommended ways to get around </h4>
  
  
  <h5>1.Electric Scooter Hire: Lime: </h5>
  <p><br>There are a few options but my personal favourite is ‚ÄòLime‚Äô It has 
    <br>an easy smartphone app for unlocking/locking the scooters. The app shows 
    <br>you where thr scooters are located and how much battery each has. It doesn‚Äôt 
    <br>come with a helmet- so bring or buy one. I prefer riding round on a scooter 
    <br>to public transport- as you can just stop when you see something of interest to you.
  </p>
    
  
     <h5>2. Taxi: Bolt </h5>
  <p><br>Bolt taxi is very similar to uber- location by phone and ordering on the app. 
    <br> Make sure to download the app before you go on holiday to familiarise yourself 
    <br> with how it works, Bolt is safer than using public transport at night and is a convenience during the day. 
  </p>
      
  
  <h5>3. Trolley </h5>
  <p>The trolley‚Äôs in Budapest are very cool. They are cover most of the city, 
  <br>and give you the experience of seeing the full city from an older method of transport. 
  <br>Following the route of tram number 2 all the way around gives you the best view of a 
  <br>lot of tourist spots. So if you don‚Äôt have a lot of time and want to cover it all this 
  <br>is a good option. </p>
  
  
  
  
  <h3>üçπLastly, at the end of a long day sight seeing where do you get a drink!?</h3>
  
  
    <p> Since you are on your hols dont worry about what areas to go to for the best 
        and safest night spots we've got you covered
    </p>
    
    <h4> Heres our top 3 areas to for a boogie</h4>
    
  <h5>Gozsdu Udvar</h5>
  <p><br>Gozsdue Court is open to visitors all night. Its passages and alleyways are 
    <br>packed with bars and great restaurants, serving high quality foods and drinks for
    <br>guests. A host of wine bars, cafes, wok and tapas bars and pizzerias offer
    <br>tempting treats to suit all tastes. It‚Äôs worth checking out the entertainment 
    <br>in the bars, too, as many DJs regularly perform in Gozsdu! Gozsdu was a lot of fun! 
    <br>Get here on a weekend or Friday night to see It as its best. 
      </p>

  <h5>Kazinczy Street</h5>
  <p><br>Szimpla Kert is the oldest ruin pub in the area. Ruin pubs/bars are old buildings
    <br>that are rented and turned into pubs, with their interiors decorated with an eccentric
    <br>array of vintage furnishings. It‚Äôs definitely worth a look, but is now ,very touristy 
    <br>so if your looking for a more local experience head to one of the many cheaper cocktail/bars.
    <br>There are multiple clubs to dance all night here, and in the adjacent streets. 

  <h5>The Embankment</h5>
  <p><br>For a more chilled night out, with open-air venues hosting live music head to district 
  <br>9 on the Embankment. There are varyhing styles and genres of live music so check ahead for what
  <br>you want to see. One of the best places to get Craft Beer is within this district. Also a local
  <br>Jazz bar which is always happening.
